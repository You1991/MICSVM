This is not an official release. We have removed many things from the software to make it as simple as possible.
Because we are still working on a related paper, we can only release some example soruce codes.
These codes only support gaussian (rbf) kernel without adpative support.
To run the example, just enter the code folder.
For example, to run the CSR CPU code, you just need to do:
>> ./testcpu.sh
