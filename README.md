Due to the paper describing this software now is under review of IPDPS 2014, we only provide some example source codes. 

We will release all the source codes, test datasets and provide detailed tutorial once the paper is accepted.

for the test, just execute two command lines:

$chmod 777 test.sh

$./test.sh

After this, you will get a .mdl file and you can use libsvm to validate the correctness and obtain the accuracy.
